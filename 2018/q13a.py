# Really liked this one. I solved it with complex numbers, which is a trick I learned from earlier years.
# Instead of storing x and y, store position = x + y * i (written y * 1j in python).
#
# The best part about this is that directions are just one of the numbers +1, +1j, -1, -1j and changing a direction
# is as simple as multiplying it by either +1j (clockwise turn) or -1j (counterclockwise turn).
#
# Note that since the Y axis is flipped (positive = down),
# you flip the imaginary part compared to what you'd do in usual mathematics
# (therefore, multiplying by +1j is CW тно, not CCW тнп).
